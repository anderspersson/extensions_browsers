# extensions_browsers
This is a project for helping in debugging of Microsoft Business Central.
When you debug the compiler opens a webbpage, but to open it with a user account and debug
you have to copy the URL and open it in a "private" windows, this extensions does this
when the page open just press the button, and the same url is open in private mode.
